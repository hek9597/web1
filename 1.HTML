<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가</h2>


<p>I think confidence is the most necessary characteristic to live a successful life. The confidence I’m talking about can be seen as a willingness to carry out goals you’ve set with confidence.
And if you want a successful life, of course, you have to have a clear goal. If you don’t have confidence in your goals, you’ll soon give up, and this can always happen wasting time.
Taking an example of my friend's story, my middle school friend said he would study video editing in the first grade and make money using it.</p>
 However, until the second year of middle school, he had no confidence in these goals, so he gave up. Because of this, he entered a bad high school, and he is regretting until now.
 There are many of these cases around us. They give up because they lack confidence in achieving their goals.
In conclusion, Confidence is one of the best characteristic for success.
If you have achieved your goal based on confidence in your goal, your fear for the next challenge will turn into confidence in your achievement.
 In conclusion, the word, “Confidence” is the key to achieving goals that lead to success
